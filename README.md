##UNIVERSE 
Be part of a community on campus through Universe proximity chat.

The application adds users to chat rooms that are based around popular places on campus(ex: ICT building). 

When we started this project, our primary focus was on helping students make friends around places thry frequent, in order to build a community. A geolocation based chat rooms that are only visible when near the location allow ppl to be sitting in a building and have access to other students regardless of if they know them. This allows new students as well as upper years to be involved socially without having to work up the courage to talk to groups of people in person.
